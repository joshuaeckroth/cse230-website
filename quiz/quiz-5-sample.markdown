This quiz will ask you to write a single function that does something with a
linked list. You'll want to understand the functions shown on the [linked
list](/lecture/linked-lists.html) lecture notes. For practice, you can try
writing a function that removes the last occurrence of some value. Your
function can refer to existing functions, if you find that easier.
