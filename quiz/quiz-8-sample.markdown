This quiz will ask you to use `vector`, `map`, and `set` to do some
interesting things. You'll want to know how to do the following:

- Create a `vector`, `map`, and `set` of any type(s)

- Put stuff in the collection (`vector` uses `push_back`, `map` uses
  the `[]` syntax, and `set` uses `insert`)
  
- Search for elements (or search for keys in a map), using the `find`
  function

- Print all the elements (in the map, print both the keys and values),
  using an iterator and a `for` loop
