This quiz will ask you to write some code that works with vectors (see
the [Vector lecture notes](/lecture/vectors.html)).

You will need to write code that adds data to a vector, prints data
from a vector, and sorts a vector. The data will come from the
user. You only have to write the `main()` function, and the
`#include`'s will already be provided.
