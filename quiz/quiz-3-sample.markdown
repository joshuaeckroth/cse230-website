This quiz will have two parts:

In the first part, you will be asked to write a small amount of code
that creates and [array](/lecture/arrays.html), fills it with values
in some fashion (like asking the user for each value), and processes
the values in some way (like find the sum, find the min or max, find
the average).

In the second part, you will be asked to complete the same task with a
[vector](/lecture/vectors.html)
