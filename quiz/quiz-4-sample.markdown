This quiz will ask you to write a single function that does something
with a linked list. You'll want to understand the functions shown on
the [linked list](/lecture/linked-lists.html) lecture notes. For
practice, you can try writing a function that removes the last
occurrence of some value. Your function can refer to existing
functions, if you find that easier.
