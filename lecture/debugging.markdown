> The Titanic effect: The severity with which a system fails is
> directly proportional to the intensity of the designer's belief that
> it cannot fail. -- R.A. De Millo, R.J. Lipton, and A.J. Perlis,
> "Social processes and proofs of theorems and programs,"
> *Communications of the ACM*, 1979

## Universal technique

`cout`

> A program is a human artifact; a real-life program is a complex
> human artifact; and any human artifact of sufficient size and
> complexity is imperfect. -- (*op. cit.*)

## CodeBlocks specific techniques

## Visual Studio specific techniques

## Xcode specific techniques

> Programs are jagged and full of holes and caverns. Every programmer
> knows that altering a line or sometimes even a bit can utterly
> destroy a program or mutilate it in ways that we do not understand
> and cannot predict. And yet at other times fairly substantial
> changes seem to alter nothing; the folklore is filled with stories
> of pranks and acts of vandalism that frustrated the perpetrators by
> remaining forever undetected. -- (*op. cit.*)


## Linux specific techniques

> There is a classic science-fiction story about a time traveler who
> goes back to the primeval jungles to watch dinosaurs and then
> returns to find his own time altered almost beyond
> recognition. Politics, architecture, language--even the plants and
> animals seem wrong, distorted. Only when he removes his time-travel
> suit does he understand what has happened. On the heel of his boot,
> carried away from the past and therefore unable to perform its
> function in the evolution of the world, is crushed the wing of a
> butterfly. Every programmer knows the sensation: A trivial, minute
> change wreaks havoc in a massive system. Until we know more about
> programming, we had better for all practical purposes think of
> systems as composed, not of sturdy structures like algorithms and
> smaller programs, but of butterflies' wings. -- (*op. cit.*)
