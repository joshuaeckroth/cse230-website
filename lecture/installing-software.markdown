title: Installing required software
---

Some software is required for you to work on assignments on your own computer.
First I show how to install software on Windows (two options; you only need to
choose one), and Mac OS X (one option).

## Windows

Choose one of these recommended options:

- CodeBlocks --- much easier to use, but it is not on the OSU lab computers.

- Visual Studio Express --- harder to use, but it *is* on the OSU lab computers.

## CodeBlocks

[Download CodeBlocks (74 MB)](http://sourceforge.net/projects/codeblocks/files/Binaries/10.05/Windows/codeblocks-10.05mingw-setup.exe)

## Visual Studio Express

[Go to this webpage](http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/#2010-Visual-CPP), then click "Select language..." and choose your preferred language, then "Run" the file that begins downloading.

## Mac OS X

You will need to download XCode 3 from Apple. XCode 3 is free only if you sign
up as a Mac developer, which is free. XCode 4 is not free.

First, go to the [XCode website](http://developer.apple.com/xcode/), then
scroll down and look at the right side, "Looking for Xcode 3? Download Now";
click that. Then log in with your Apple ID or register.
