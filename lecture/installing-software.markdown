title: Installing required software
---

Some software is required for you to work on assignments on your own
computer. Here I show how to install software on Windows (two options;
you only need to choose one), and Mac OS X (one option).

**Note: when the videos say "go to learn.artifice.cc", change that to "go to
cse230.artifice.cc"**

## Windows

Choose one of these recommended options:

  - CodeBlocks -- much easier to use, but it is not on the OSU lab
    computers.

  - Visual Studio Express -- harder to use, but it *is* on the OSU lab
    computers.

## CodeBlocks

[Download CodeBlocks (74 MB)](http://sourceforge.net/projects/codeblocks/files/Binaries/10.05/Windows/codeblocks-10.05mingw-setup.exe)

## Visual Studio Express

[Go to this webpage](http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/#2010-Visual-CPP),
then click "Select language..." and choose your preferred language,
then "Run" the file that begins downloading.

## Mac OS X

You will need [Xcode 4 from Apple](http://developer.apple.com/xcode/);
click "View Xcode 4.2.1 for Lion on the Mac App Store," or just search
the Mac App Store.
