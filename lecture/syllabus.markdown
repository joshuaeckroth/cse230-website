> It goes against the grain of modern education to teach [students] to

## Grading

- Homeworks: 40% (8 of them)

- Quizzes: 30% (8 of them)

- Carmen quizzes: 10% (16 of them)

- Final exam: 20% (Wed, March 14, 3:30-5:18pm, same room as lectures)

You can see your grades on Carmen.

## Quizzes & exams

There is no midterm, per se. The quizzes, collectively, are your
midterm (so to speak). Quizzes occur every Thursday; they are short
(we still have lecture on Thursdays, a quiz should only take at most
20 minutes), and are designed to reinforce the topics.

The final exam will look like several quizzes all in one test. So the
format will be just like the quizzes. Obviously, the final exam is
"cumulative" (covers everything we learn in the course).

## Carmen quizzes

There are also required quizzes on Carmen. These are short and mostly
test small details. You can take a Carmen quiz as many times as you'd
like, any time you'd like.

## Homeworks

Homeworks are always due on a Monday, by 11:00pm. Your homework
should be sent to me by email:
[joshuaeckroth@gmail.com](mailto:joshuaeckroth@gmail.com) (attach your
files; do not paste into Microsoft Word, just literally attach `.cpp`
and `.h` files).

This material will be challenging. Consider the class like a math or
physics class. It will require a lot of thinking, staring at the
problem, planning a solution with pen & paper, etc. It's almost
impossible to fake your way through it. There are always many ways to
"solve" a programming problem, but there is an obvious difference
between code that shows you understand your solution and code that
shows you just tried every possibility. You will be graded higher if
your solution is incomplete but intelligent, than if your solution is
just a mess. Additionally, code that actually works (even if it's
incomplete) is much better than code that has errors.

Most students say that programming assignments take longer than they
expected. Trivial bugs in your code can cause you to waste hours
attempting to fix your program. The last 10% of the work takes 90% of
the time. And so on. So start early!

Or if you prefer,

> **Murphy's law of Programming** "The sooner you start coding your program,
> the longer it is going to take." -- *The computer contradictionary*

## Text book

The book is not required, but you may find it highly useful. I
generally follow the book's organization, and most homeworks are
straight from the book.  Probably any edition would be fine; I use the
7th edition.

## Academic misconduct policy

This course is designed for individual work.

The only work required of you outside of class is homework assignments
and Carmen quizzes. Obviously, there is no tolerance for cheating
(looking at others' work) during in-class quizzes, Carmen quizzes, or
the final exam. However, you may participate in a reasonable amount of
collaboration over homeworks. Collaboration is limited to: discussing
how to approach the solution, or how to solve small coding problems;
looking at the Internet for information about general topics, not
solutions to the particulars of the homework assignment. It is
considered academic misconduct if you copy significant portions of
code from anyone (the Internet included). Your solutions should not
bear an uncanny resemblance to anyone else's code. It should be clear
to you what I mean by this; do not test the limits of this (fairly
liberal) policy. Violators will be referred to the OSU Committee on
Academic Misconduct (COAM).

## Disability statement

Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation based on the
impact of a disability should contact me privately to discuss your
specific needs. Please contact the Office for Disability Services at
614-292-3307 in room 150 Pomerene Hall to coordinate reasonable
accommodations for students with documented disabilities.

## Some inspiration

> In my life as an architect, I find that the single thing which
> inhibits young professionals, new students most severely, is their
> acceptance of standards that are too low. If I ask a student whether
> her design is as good as Chartres, she often smiles tolerantly at me
> as if to say, "Of course not, that isn't what I am trying to
> do... I could never do that."

> Then, I express my disagreement, and tell her: "That standard must
> be our standard. If you are going to be a builder, no other standard
> is worthwhile. That is what I expect of myself in my own buildings,
> and it is what I expect of my students." Gradually, I show the
> students that they have a right to ask this of themselves, and
> must ask this of themselves. Once that level of standard is in their
> minds, they will be able to figure out, for themselves, how to do
> better, how to make something that is as profound as that.

> Two things emanate from this changed standard. First, the work
> becomes more fun. It is deeper, it never gets tiresome or boring,
> because one can never really attain this standard. One's work
> becomes a lifelong work, and one keeps trying and trying. So it
> becomes very fulfilling, to live in the light of a goal like this.

> But secondly, it does change what people are trying to do. It takes
> away from them the everyday, lower-level aspiration that is purely
> technical in nature, (and which we have come to accept) and replaces
> it with something deep, which will make a real difference to all of
> us that inhabit the earth. -- Christopher Alexander, from the
> Foreword to *Patterns of Software* by Richard P. Gabriel
