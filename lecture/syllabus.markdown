## Grading

- Homeworks: 50% (8 of them)

- Quizzes: 30% (8 of them)

- Final exam: 20% (Wed, Dec 7, 1:30pm-3:18pm, same room as lectures)

You can see your grades on Carmen.

## Quizzes & exams

There is no midterm, per se. The quizzes, collectively, are your
midterm (so to speak).  Quizzes occur every Wednesday; they are short
(we still have lecture on Wednesdays, a quiz should only take at most
20 minutes), and are designed to reinforce the topics.

The final exam will look like several quizzes all in one test. So the
format will be just like the quizzes. Obviously, the final exam is
"cumulative" (covers everything we learn in the course).

## Homeworks

Homeworks are always due on a Thursday, by 11:00pm. Your homework
should be sent to me by email:
[joshuaeckroth@gmail.com](mailto:joshuaeckroth@gmail.com) (attach your
files; do not paste into Microsoft Word, just literally attach `.cpp`
and `.h` files).

This material will be challenging. Consider the class like a math or
physics class. It will require a lot of thinking, staring at the
problem, planning a solution with pen & paper, etc. It's almost
impossible to fake your way through it. There are always many ways to
"solve" a programming problem, but there is an obvious difference
between code that shows you understand your solution and code that
shows you just tried every possibility. You will be graded higher if
your solution is incomplete but intelligent, than if your solution is
just a mess. Additionally, code that actually works (even if it's
incomplete) is much better than code that has errors. Partial credit
will be abundant, however.

Most students say that programming assignments take longer than they
expected. Trivial bugs in your code can cause you to waste hours
attempting to fix your program. The last 10% of the work takes 90% of
the time. And so on. So start early!

Or if you prefer,

> **Murphy's law of Programming** "The sooner you start coding your program,
> the longer it is going to take." -- *The computer contradictionary*

## Text book

The book is not required, but you may find it highly useful. I
generally follow the book's organization, and most homeworks are
straight from the book.  Probably any edition would be fine; I use the
7th edition.

## Pizza -- I mean Piazza

I'm going to attempt to use an online tool called "Piazza" for class
collaboration. I will demonstrate it in class. The idea is that
students write questions on that website, and everyone in the class
can see the questions as well as any answers that I provide or other
students provide. Students can write anonymously as well.

Theoretically, everybody saves time because you may not have to ask a
question if it's already answered on Piazza and I won't have to answer
a question more than once.

The website is [piazza.com](http://piazza.com) -- in class, I'll show
everybody how to access it.

## Academic misconduct policy

This course is designed for individual work, unless specifically
stated otherwise.

The only work required of you outside of class is homework
assignments. Obviously, there is no tolerance for cheating (looking at
others' work) during quizzes or the final exam. However, you may
participate in a reasonable amount of collaboration over
homeworks. Collaboration is limited to: discussing how to approach the
solution, or how to solve small coding problems; looking at the
Internet for information about general topics, not solutions to the
particulars of the homework assignment. Anything posted on Piazza
(described above) is fair-game. It is considered academic misconduct
if you copy significant portions of code from anyone (the Internet
included). Your solutions should not bear an uncanny resemblance to
anyone else's code. It should be clear to you what I mean by this; do
not test the limits of this (fairly liberal) policy. Violators will be
referred to the OSU Committee on Academic Misconduct (COAM).

## Disability statement

Any student who feels he or may need an accommodation based on the
impact of a disability should contact me privately to discuss your
specific needs. Please contact the Office for Disability Services at
614-292-3307 in room 150 Pomerene Hall to coordinate reasonable
accommodations for students with documented disabilities.
